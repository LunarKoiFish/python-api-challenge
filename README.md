# python-api-challenge

In this API challenge, we are given the task of using are new skills of python requests, APIs, and JSON traverals to answer the given question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Short answer: The weather is certainly warmer and have a higher Max Temperature when closer to the equator.

This challenge is separated into two parts. In the 1st part we need to write a python script that visualizes weather of many cities with varying distance from the equator. Once we have retrieved data using API, we then create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude before computing each of their linear regression. Next, in ther 2nd part, we will the weather data we retrieved from the 1st part to then help us plan future vacations. To do that we created a map visualization containing cities with our specific weather needs that shows us a hotel with the help of Geoapify API.

In these python files, Xpert Learning assistant was used to support and guide me along my work to keep my work organized and correct any mistake I could have made. As well providing some lines of code to help me on parts where I was stuck on.
